# Convert Pixel2 to Pixel9 Concrete CMS CIF Files

Do you have a website with concrete5 v8 that uses the old Pixel 2 theme and you want to switch to Concrete CMS v9+ with a new [Pixel 9](https://market.concretecms.com/products/2140e37d-cf89-11ee-b9df-0a97d4ce16b9) theme?

You can do the following:

1. In your old concrete5 v8 website install the [Migration Tool package](https://github.com/concretecms/addon_migration_tool)
2. Export the website content to XML files (the so-called CIF Format)
3. Install [this pixel2to9 package](https://github.com/mlocati/pixel2to9) and convert the XML files
4. In your new ConcreteCMS v9+ website install the [Migration Tool package](https://github.com/concretecms/migration_tool)
5. Import the XML files
